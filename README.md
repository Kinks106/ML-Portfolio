## 🔧 How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE]
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a project folder:**
    (Note: All projects are in the root folder as `.ipynb` files)
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    (It's recommended to create a single `requirements.txt` file for all projects)
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  Run the Jupyter Notebook to see the project.
